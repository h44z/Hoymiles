# Hoymiles
Hoymiles DTU (Telemetry Gateway) Library for ESP8266.

This library is based on code from the [OpenDTU](https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU) project written by Thomas Basler.


## Description

The goal of this project is to provide a replacement for the original Hoymiles DTU (Telemetry Gateway) without mandatory Hoymiles Cloud integration.

## Hardware requirements

This project was tested with ESP8266 (WeMos D1 mini) and NRF24L01+ boards.
